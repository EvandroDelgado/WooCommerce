# WooCommerce
This is a project made in my school with the goal: build an Website in WordPress using WooCommerce.

In this way, groups consisting of three elements were created. In this case, the ultimate goal is to develop and implement an E-Commerce
capable to handle orders of traditional food products from countries like Portugal, Cabo Verde and Brasil.

Plug-in used:
- WooCommerce;
- Google Maps Embed;
- WPForms Lite;
- Float To Top Button;
- GA Google Analytics;
- Mesmerize Companion.
